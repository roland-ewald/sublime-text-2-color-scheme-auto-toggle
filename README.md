Simple Sublime Text 2 plugin that automatically toggles between two color schemes, depending on whether it is night or day. Needs to be configured with user's location to calculate accurate sunrise / sunset times.

To make this work, you need to configure your time zone and location in `AutoToggleColorScheme.py`. 

Then, just copy both `*.py` files to `[ST2]\Packages\User`.

The code is in the public domain.
